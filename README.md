# Virtual-Reality-Football
Using the Unity game engine, I created a fully immersive football gauntlet styled game. The game uses an Oculus Rift and a Microsoft Kinect to track all head and body movements. The player gets to experience being an NFL wide reciever running down the field catching passes from quarterbacks.
